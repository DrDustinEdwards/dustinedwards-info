/**
 * Gate: the site as a BROWSER LAYS IT OUT, not as markup.
 *
 *   npm run check:browser
 *   npm run check:browser -- --keep    leave the preview server running
 *
 * ## OBSERVATION BOUNDARY
 *
 * **ONE BROWSER, ONE ENGINE.** Chromium, via the Puppeteer already installed in
 * this repo. Nothing here says anything about Firefox, Safari or WebKit on iOS,
 * and the layout defects this repo has shipped were engine-agnostic, so that is
 * a real limit rather than a theoretical one.
 *
 * **TWO VIEWPORTS**, 1280x900 and 320x800. A defect that appears only at 768 or
 * only at 1440 is invisible here. 320 is the narrowest commonly cited phone
 * width and the one the recorded defects were about; 1280 is where the column
 * layout is supposed to be at its widest.
 *
 * **IT LOADS A LOCAL PREVIEW BUILD, not the deployed Worker.** So it proves what
 * the working tree renders, which is the point, and proves nothing about what is
 * live. `verify-live` owns that and needs the wire.
 *
 * **IT DOES NOT LOOK.** Every assertion is a number from `getBoundingClientRect`
 * or an attribute from the DOM. A page that lays out correctly and is unreadable,
 * mis-coloured, or has its z-order inverted passes here. Screenshots would need a
 * human or a baseline, and a baseline is a fixture that drifts.
 *
 * **THE ADMIN CASE IS OPT-IN AND SKIPS LOUDLY.** See ADMIN_COOKIE below.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Audit 2.3. Twenty-seven gates and none of them had ever laid out a page:
 * `check:admin-ui` renders routes with `.server` imports stubbed AND NO
 * STYLESHEET, and says so in its own header. Five layout defects shipped
 * invisible to the whole suite, and a sixth class, a component that renders in
 * markup and fails to MOUNT, took the editor down for two days with every gate
 * green.
 *
 * ## Why Puppeteer rather than Playwright
 *
 * Playwright is the better tool in the abstract: three engines, better tracing,
 * better waiting primitives. It was rejected on cost that is specific to this
 * repo. **Puppeteer 25.4.0 is ALREADY a declared devDependency** and its Chrome
 * is already downloaded, because `build:diagrams` renders mermaid through
 * `@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`, which drives Puppeteer. Adding Playwright means a
 * second browser stack, a second ~150MB download in `npm ci`, and two automation
 * APIs in one repo, to gain engines this gate's own boundary already says it is
 * not testing. Verified before choosing: `puppeteer.launch()` succeeded headless
 * on Chrome/151.0.7922.47 with no install step.
 *
 * ## Why a PREVIEW build and not the dev server
 *
 * MEASURED, and it nearly produced a spec that asserted nothing. Against
 * `npm run dev` the page came back with `document.styleSheets.length === 1`,
 * `0` total CSS rules, `getComputedStyle(.page-head).maxWidth === "none"` and an
 * 8px body margin: the app stylesheet was not applied at all, so `.blog-search`
 * and `.page-head` measured identical full-bleed widths and every column
 * assertion would have passed on an unstyled page. That is exactly the
 * `check:admin-ui` failure this gate exists to replace, reproduced by accident.
 * The preview build serves `assets/root-*.css` as a real stylesheet and the same
 * measurement immediately separated 1216px from 768px.

 * A real admin session cookie, or nothing.
 *
 * **THE ADMIN CASE CANNOT BE FAKED AND IS NOT.** Better Auth holds the session
 * in KV, the single admin signs in through Google, and this repo has NO
 * `.dev.vars` by design, so no local server can mint a session. A test-only
 * bypass would mean the spec authenticates through a path production does not
 * have, and the defect it exists to catch, the editor's Suspense boundary
 * failing under the enforced CSP, lives in the real authenticated render. A
 * stub would have passed while the editor was broken in production.
 *
 * So the cookie is supplied from outside or the case does not run. When it is
 * absent this SKIPS and says so; it never passes quietly, because a silent skip
 * is how a gate reports success for work it did not do.
