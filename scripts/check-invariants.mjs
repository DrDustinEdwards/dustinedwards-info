/**
 * Gate over rules this repo states TWICE and cannot merge into one.
 *
 *   npm run check:invariants
 *
 * OBSERVATION BOUNDARY: it compares the two implementations of a rule against
 * each other over a fixture. It does not know whether the rule itself is right,
 * so two implementations that agree on the WRONG answer pass here. What it
 * catches is divergence, which is the failure this repo has actually suffered.
 *
 * Pure: no network, no database, no bindings. It bundles TypeScript with esbuild
 * to reach modules the Worker imports, the same technique `check:admin-ui` uses,
 * and runs the SQL halves against an in-memory SQLite from `node:sqlite`.
 *
 * ## What belongs here, and what emphatically does not
 *
 * A pair belongs here when the same rule is expressed twice IN DIFFERENT
 * LANGUAGES OR RUNTIMES, so it cannot be collapsed into one function. Two copies
 * of the same expression in the same language are not an invariant to gate, they
 * are duplication to delete: `bucketFor` was three copies and is now one in
 * `classify.mjs`, and `LANGUAGES` is derived from `GRAMMARS` rather than kept
 * beside it. Asserting a single function agrees with itself proves nothing and
 * would be a gate that can never fail.
 *
 * So this file holds exactly three sections, and the first is not a comparison:
 *
 *   1. NO SECOND BUCKET SELECTION. Structural. The dedupe above is only true
 *      while it stays true, and the failure mode now is a fourth copy appearing
 *      in a file nobody thought to check.
 *   2. publiclyVisible() vs visibilityClause(). Drizzle conditions against a
 *      hand-written SQL string, over the same rule. Hard rule 1 lives in both.
 *   3. The two resolveImage paths. Node and Worker. Since finding B002 both are
 *      pure functions of the key string, which is what makes them comparable at
 *      all; before it, one read the filesystem and the other read R2.
 *
 * FAILS CLOSED. Every section asserts its fixture is non-empty and its scan
 * examined files, so "0 problems" can never quietly mean "0 things examined".
