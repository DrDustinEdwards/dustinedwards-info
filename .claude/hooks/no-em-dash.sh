# PreToolUse hook: blocks any Write or Edit whose incoming content carries an em
# or en dash. Canon: capsid/conventions.md.
#
# PreToolUse plus exit 2 is the only combination that blocks the tool call.
# PostToolUse fires after the write has landed and cannot undo it.
#
# Parser: python3 (ships with the Xcode Command Line Tools; jq does not ship on
# macOS). If python3 is missing the hook exits 1, a loud non-blocking error in
# the transcript, rather than silently passing. An enforcement hook that fails
# open in silence is worse than no hook: the first draft of this script used jq
# and exited 0 on a real em dash on any box without jq. Functionally tested
# 2026-07-16: em dash in Write content blocks (2), en dash in Edit new_string
# blocks (2), clean content passes (0), an Edit whose old_string removes a dash
# passes (0), missing fields pass (0), malformed JSON passes (0).
#
# Only content and new_string are checked, deliberately: old_string must be
# allowed to contain a dash, otherwise an edit that fixes one can never run.
